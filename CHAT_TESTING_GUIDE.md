# 🧪 Chat Fix - Testing Guide

## Quick Test (2 Minutes)

### 1. Start the App
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open: http://localhost:5173

### 2. Test Message Sending
1. Log in to your account
2. Open Messages/Chat
3. Send a message: "test message"
4. **Watch for**:
   - ✅ Message appears immediately
   - ✅ No "Sending..." stuck
   - ✅ Message confirmed within 1 second

### 3. Test Real-Time Sync
1. Open a second browser window (incognito/private)
2. Log in with a different account
3. Send messages between the two accounts
4. **Watch for**:
   - ✅ Messages appear in both windows instantly
   - ✅ No refresh needed
   - ✅ No duplicates

---

## What to Watch in Console

Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab

### ✅ Good Signs (What You Should See)

**When sending a message**:
```
[useRealTimeChat] Sending message to: <id> Text: test message
[useRealTimeChat] Message saved to database: <uuid>
[ChatService] Real-time SENT message confirmation: <payload>
[useRealTimeChat] Real message already in state (from subscription)
[useRealTimeChat] Message sent successfully: <uuid>
```

**When receiving a message**:
```
[ChatService] Real-time RECEIVED message: <payload>
[useRealTimeChat] Real-time message received: <details>
[useRealTimeChat] Added new message to state, total: <count>
```

### ❌ Bad Signs (Issues to Report)

**Message stuck**:
```
[useRealTimeChat] Sending message to: <id>
... (10 seconds pass with no more logs) ...
[useRealTimeChat] Message send timeout, clearing pending status
```
→ This means there's a network or database issue

**Duplicate messages**:
```
[useRealTimeChat] Message already exists, skipping duplicate: <id>
```
→ Multiple times for the same message

**Subscription errors**:
```
[ChatService] Subscription error: TIMED_OUT
```
→ Realtime connection failed

## Debug Checklist

If messages are still stuck:

### 1. Check Supabase Realtime
- [ ] Go to Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Database → Replication
- [ ] Verify `chat_messages` is enabled
- [ ] Check for "supabase_realtime" publication

### 2. Check Database Columns
- [ ] Run the `update_chat_messages_schema_SAFE.sql`
- [ ] Verify columns exist: file_url, file_name, file_type, file_size, mime_type
- [ ] Check indexes are created

### 3. Check Network
- [ ] Open DevTools → Network tab
- [ ] Filter by "realtime" or "ws"
- [ ] Should see WebSocket connection
- [ ] Status should be "101 Switching Protocols"

### 4. Check Console for Errors
- [ ] Look for red errors in console
- [ ] Check for "401 Unauthorized" (auth issue)
- [ ] Check for "403 Forbidden" (RLS policy issue)

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Sending..." appears but message never completes

**Possible causes**:
1. Realtime not enabled → Run SQL migration
2. Network issue → Check internet connection
3. RLS policy blocking → Check Supabase policies

**Quick fix**:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, verify policy exists:
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'chat_messages' 
AND policyname = 'Users can send messages';
```

---

### Issue: Messages appear after refresh but not real-time

**Possible causes**:
1. WebSocket not connecting
2. Subscription not established
3. Filter not matching

**Quick fix**:
1. Check console for `[ChatService] Successfully subscribed to real-time messages`
2. If missing, check browser console for errors
3. Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

---

### Issue: Duplicate messages appearing

**Should be fixed now**, but if still happening:
1. Check console for duplicate detection logs
2. Look for multiple subscription channels
3. Clear browser cache and reload

---

## Advanced Testing

### Test 1: Rapid Fire Messages
Send 10 messages quickly:
```
Message 1
Message 2
Message 3
...
Message 10
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ All appear in order
- ✅ None stuck at "Sending..."
- ✅ No duplicates
- ✅ All confirmed within 2-3 seconds total

---

### Test 2: Network Throttling
1. DevTools → Network → Throttling → Slow 3G
2. Send a message
3. Wait 10 seconds

**Expected**:
- ✅ "Sending..." shows
- ✅ After 10 seconds, pending status clears
- ✅ Toast shows success or error
- ✅ No permanent stuck state

---

### Test 3: File Upload
1. Click file upload button
2. Select a PDF or image
3. Send

**Expected**:
- ✅ Upload progress shows
- ✅ Message with file appears
- ✅ No stuck at "Sending..."
- ✅ File is accessible

---

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance

| Action | Expected Time | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Send message | < 500ms | ✅ |
| Real-time receive | < 1 second | ✅ |
| Pending timeout | 10 seconds | ✅ |
| File upload | 2-5 seconds | ✅ |

---

## Success Criteria
