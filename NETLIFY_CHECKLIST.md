Publish directory: dist
Node version: 18
```

### 3. Environment Variables Required
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key (optional)
```

### 4. Domain Configuration
Update Supabase Auth settings with your Netlify domain:
```
Site URL: https://your-app.netlify.app
Redirect URLs: https://your-app.netlify.app
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version in Netlify settings
2. **404 on routes**: Verify `_redirects` file copied to dist
3. **Auth errors**: Check Supabase redirect URLs match domain
4. **Env vars**: Ensure they start with `VITE_` prefix

### Build Verification:
```bash
# Test locally before deploying:
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```
