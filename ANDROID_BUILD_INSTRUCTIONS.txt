# BeanHealth Android Build Instructions

The Android project is fully configured and "production ready" with the latest code, icons, and splash screens.

## Prerequisite
You need **Android Studio** installed on your Mac.
(Note: Java was not detecting in this terminal environment, so the final build step requires Android Studio).

## How to Build the APK

1. **Open Android Studio**.
2. **Open Project**:
   - Select **"Open"** (or "Open an existing Android Studio project").
   - Navigate to this folder: `/Users/jnanismart/Downloads/BeanHealth-main/android`
   - Click **Open**.

3. **Wait for Sync**:
   - Android Studio will take a moment to sync with Gradle. Wait until the bottom status bar is idle.

4. **Build APK**:
   - In the top menu, go to **Build** > **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** > **Build APK(s)**.
   - Once finished, a popup will appear. Click **"locate"** to find your `app-debug.apk`.

5. **Run on Device/Emulator**:
   - Connect your Android phone or start an emulator.
   - Click the green **Run (Play)** button in the top toolbar.

## Release Build (Signed APK for Play Store)
To generate a signed APK for the Google Play Store:
1. Go to **Build** > **Generate Signed Bundle / APK**.
2. Select **Android App Bundle** (standard for Play Store) or **APK**.
3. Create a new Key store (or choose an existing one).
4. Select `release` build type.
5. Finish.

## Recent Updates
- **Icons & Splash**: High-quality icons and splash screens have been generated from your logo.
- **Config**: Application ID is set to `com.beanhealth.app`.
- **Assets**: Latest web build (`dist`) has been synced to the Android project.
