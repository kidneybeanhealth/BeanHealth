# Chat File Upload Feature Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of file upload functionality for the BeanHealth chat system, allowing doctors to send prescriptions (PDFs), images, and voice recordings to patients.

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Types Supported
- **PDF Documents**: Prescriptions, medical reports (max 10MB)
- **Images**: X-rays, photos, diagrams (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, max 5MB)
- **Audio Files**: Voice messages and notes (WebM, MP3, WAV, OGG, MP4, max 25MB)

### 2. Components Created

#### Core Upload Components
- **`FileUploader.tsx`**: Generic drag-and-drop file uploader with validation
- **`ChatFilePicker.tsx`**: Chat-specific file type selector modal
- **`AudioRecorder.tsx`**: Voice recording component with play/pause/stop controls
- **`FileMessage.tsx`**: Display component for file messages with previews and download

#### Key Features
- Drag and drop file uploads
- Real-time audio recording with visual feedback
- File type and size validation
- Upload progress indicators
- Image previews in chat
- Audio playback controls
- File download functionality

### 3. Database Schema Updates

#### New Columns in `chat_messages` table:
```sql
-- File-related columns
file_url TEXT           -- URL to the uploaded file
file_name TEXT          -- Original filename
file_type TEXT          -- 'pdf', 'image', 'audio'
file_size INTEGER       -- File size in bytes
mime_type TEXT          -- Actual MIME type

-- Constraints
CONSTRAINT valid_file_type CHECK (file_type IS NULL OR file_type IN ('pdf', 'image', 'audio'))
CONSTRAINT message_content_check CHECK (text IS NOT NULL OR audio_url IS NOT NULL OR file_url IS NOT NULL)
```

### 4. Storage Configuration

#### Supabase Storage Setup
- New bucket: `chat-files`
- Organized folder structure: `chat-files/{conversationId}/{fileType}/{filename}`
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for access control
- File type and size restrictions at storage level

### 5. Services Extended

#### Storage Service (`storageService.ts`)
- `uploadChatFile()`: Upload any file type to organized folders
- `uploadAudioRecording()`: Convert audio blob to file and upload
- `deleteChatFile()`: Remove files from storage
- `getChatFileInfo()`: Retrieve file metadata

#### Chat Service (`chatService.ts`)
- `sendFileMessage()`: Send messages with file attachments
- Updated message retrieval to include file metadata
- Real-time subscriptions handle file messages

### 6. Type System Updates

#### Enhanced `ChatMessage` interface:
```typescript
export interface ChatMessage {
  // ... existing fields
  fileUrl?: string;
  fileName?: string;
  fileType?: 'pdf' | 'image' | 'audio';
  fileSize?: number;
  mimeType?: string;
}
```

### 7. UI/UX Features

#### Chat Interface Enhancements
- File upload button in message input area
- Audio recording toggle button
- Upload progress indicators
- File message bubbles with appropriate previews
- Download and playback controls
- Error handling with user feedback

#### User Experience
- Intuitive file type selection modal
- Visual feedback during uploads
- Seamless integration with existing urgent message system
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Security Considerations

### 1. File Validation
- Client-side file type and size validation
- Server-side MIME type verification
- Maximum file size limits per type

### 2. Access Control
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their conversation files
- Conversation-based folder organization
- Authenticated upload/download only

### 3. Storage Security
- Files stored in organized bucket structure
- Public URLs but access-controlled
- Proper file cleanup capabilities

## Usage Instructions

### For Doctors:
1. **Send Prescription PDF**: Click file attachment → Select PDF → Choose prescription file
2. **Send Image**: Click file attachment → Select Image → Choose medical image
3. **Send Voice Note**: Click microphone → Record → Preview → Send

### For Patients:
- Receive all file types from doctors
- Download files for offline viewing
- Play audio messages directly in chat
- View image previews inline

## Database Migration Required

Run these SQL files in your Supabase SQL editor:

1. **`chat_file_upload_schema.sql`**: Adds file columns to chat_messages table
2. **`chat_files_storage_setup.sql`**: Creates storage bucket and policies

## File Structure

```

└── chatService.ts           # Extended with file message support

types.ts                      # Updated ChatMessage interface
```

## Error Handling

### Upload Failures
- Network errors with retry options
- File size/type validation errors
- Storage quota exceeded warnings
- User-friendly error messages

### Playback Issues
- Audio playback fallback for unsupported formats
- Image loading error handling with download fallback
- PDF preview limitations with download option

## Performance Optimizations

### File Management
- Lazy loading of file content
- Efficient storage organization
- Proper cleanup of temporary files
- Optimized image sizes for chat previews

### Real-time Updates
- Optimistic UI updates during uploads
- Efficient message synchronization
- Minimal re-renders for file messages

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- File compression for images
- Audio transcription services
- PDF thumbnail generation
- Batch file uploads
- File search functionality
- Cloud storage integration options

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready file upload system for the BeanHealth chat feature, enabling doctors to effectively share prescriptions, medical images, and voice notes with their patients.
